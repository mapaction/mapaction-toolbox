= About the MapAction Data Names Tool  =

The MapAction data names tool is a plug-in to ArcGIS Desktop to assist in naming GIS data according to MapAction’s data naming convention SOPs. It provides feedback on whether or not a particular layer of data is correctly named, and if it not the tool provides suggestions as to the likely clause of the problems. The tool operates by comparing the parts (or clauses) of a data name to predefined lookup tables, which themselves can be edited by the user as appropriate. It can also be used to rename individual data layers as required and operates with shapefiles, raster files, features classes stored in both local and SDE geodatabases and if required any other type of file (eg. DBF, text file and spreadsheets etc). The Data Name tool as been developed and tested using ArcGIS Desktop 9.3.1 and Windows XP SP3 and Windows Server 2003. It has not been tested with other versions of ArcGIS (notably v10). We would very much welcome any feedback users may have in attempting to use this tool on any other platform. The Data Naming Tool is licensed under GPL v3. 

= Installing the tools  =

Download the installer from here: [http://mapaction-toolbox.googlecode.com/files/MAdataNameToolsv1.0RC1.msi http://mapaction-toolbox.googlecode.com/files/MAdataNameToolsv1.0RC1.msi]

Make sure that any ESRI products are closed before attempting to install the Data Naming Tools. Double click on the MSI file to start the installation. It is recommended that you choose the default options when installing. 

Once the installer is finished, start either ArcCatalog or ArcMap. The “Ma Data Names Tools” toolbar should appear. If not you may need to enable the toolbar from the View -&gt; Toolbars menu. http://code.google.com/p/mapaction-toolbox/wiki/images/Datanametool-v1.0-enable-toolbar.png

= What make a name “correct” or not?  =

The Data Naming convention is explained in detail [[Data Naming Convention|here]], though summaries below. Each data name consists of a number of clauses which describe the contents:
<pre>geoextent_datacategory_datatheme_datatype[_scale]_source[_permission][_FreeText]</pre>
A dataname is considered to be "correct" if both: 

*It's syntax matches the syntax given above. 
*Each individual clause is checked against and found on a collection of "datanaming tables" which contain valid values for each clause.

The Data Name Tool checks both of these conditions. In general it will automatically find the list of datanaming tables. If you are storing your data in the MapAction Crash Move directory structure, the tool will normally automatically locate the list of datanaming tables, and would rarely require the user to override this selection.

= Checking Names – a simple case  =

The tool operates by checking the names of all of the layers stored within a directory, geodatabase, or referenced by an MXD. The user selected the location of the data. The tool works best when the relevant data is stored within the MapAction Crash Move directory. The screenshot shows the Data Name tool main window when launched from within ArcCatalog. The top box “Data Sources” allows the user to select the location of the data to be checked. 

*When launched from within ArcCatalog the tool will default to the currently selected directory or GDB. 
*When launched from within ArcMap the tool will default to the current MXD.

The “green light” at the right hand end of the box indicates that a valid data source list has been identified. If the selected data source list is not valid (eg the path of a nonexistent directory has been entered) then the light will show red.

The second box, “Data Name Clause Lookup Tables”, indicates where the list of lookup tables for list of valid clauses. When using the MapAction Crash Move directory, this is normally set automatically and does not need to be changed by the user. The section [[Data name tools#Understanding_how_the_Data_Name_Lookup_Tables_are_automatically_located|Understanding the Data Name Lookup Tables]] explains how and when a user might wish to select this manually. Again there is a green light which indicates a valid set of lookup tables has been found. A red light indicates that the lookup tables have not been found. When both green lights appear it is possible to check the names of the data. Press the “Check Data Names” button: 

[[Image:Datanametool-v1.0-main-dialog-both-green-post-check.png|center]] 

In this case there are four shapefiles, three of which are correctly named and one of which is not.

= Renaming data  =

To rename a data layer simply press the “Rename” button. This will open the rename dialog shown below:

[[Image:Datanametool-v1.0-rename-dialog.png|center]]

The dialog shows the original name of the data layer, the detected geometry type for the layer and a reminder of the syntax for the naming convention. Enter the new name in the New Name text box. 

*Any non-allowed characters (eg spaces, hyphens etc) are automatically substituted with underscores. 
*Two consecutive underscores are not permitted. 
*Below the New Name box there is feedback on the current status of the new name. This is updated as you type.

Click OK to rename the layer, or cancel otherwise. 

= Understanding how the Data Name Lookup Tables are automatically located  =

The Data Name Tool will attempt to location the Data Naming Lookup tables automatically. It is not expected that you will normally need to override the automatically selection, however possible scenarios might be if you are creating new Crash Move directory, or if you are preparing data for upload in the MapAction pre-deployment GDB. Below is a Summary of how the tool will automatically search for the lookup tables: 

*If the data is in a Geodatabase then the tool will initially search for the lookup tables within that Geodatabase. 
*If the data are shapefiles in a directory structure, or the lookup tables do not exist in the GDB, then the tool, will look for an Access database named “data_naming_conventions_v1.0.mdb” in the “2_Active_Data” directory in the Crash Move Directory. 
*If the lookup tables cannot be found automatically in either of these locations or you wish to choose a different set of lookup tables, you can manually select the location of your lookup tables.

It is planned that later versions of the Data Name Tools the automatic search for the lookup tables will be made more amenable to working with directory structures other than the MapAction Crash Move Directory. A full description of how the search process is implemented is given [http://code.google.com/p/mapaction-toolbox/wiki/SearchForDefaultDataNameClauseLookupTables here] 

= Other options  =

== Searching subdirectories and feature datasets  ==

When using a Data Source list which is hierarchical (e.g. directories or geodatabases), by default only data layers in the top level are check. By selecting the “Recuse” option you can choose to drill down to select more data layers. 

*In the case of directories all subdirectories are search in addition to the current one. 
*In the case of geodatabases, this means that the contents of feature datasets are included in addition to those feature classes in the top level of the geodatabase.

== Checking names from MXDs  ==

It is possible to check the names of all of the layer and tables referenced from an MXD file. The tool checks the actual filename of the data “on the disk” rather than the name as it appears in the Table of Contents in the map. At present it is not possible to rename a data layer when searching based on a MXD filename. In future versions it is planned that it will be possible to rename data layers when using a MXD, and the MXD will be updated to point to the new name. 

== Using the “built in” Data Name Lookup Tables  ==

If for some reason it is not possible to use either the automatic selection of data name tables, nor manually select the tables, then it is possible to choose the “built-in” option. This references a read-only sample copy of the data name lookup table, which are installed along with the toolbar itself. It should be emphasised that using the built-in data name lookup tables is a last resort and really only intended to act as a demo for new users. By default the fall back data naming tables are installed here: %Programfiles%\MapAction\dataNameTools\fall_back_data_naming_conventions_v1.0.mdb If necessary it is suggested that you copy this file into your working directory and use it there.
